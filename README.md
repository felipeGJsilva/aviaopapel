# **Test Documentation – Paper Airplane Project (Category: Longest Distance)**

## **Test 1 – “Dart” Model**  
**Flight Result:** Unsuccessful  

### **Test Description:**  
We initially chose a dart-style model aiming for greater flight distance, as this format is generally known for better aerodynamics.

### **Observed Outcome:**  
During testing, the model showed structural instability, resulting in a short flight. The plane glided for approximately **2 meters**, but quickly lost altitude and hit the ground.

### **Conclusion:**  
Performance was unsatisfactory due to poor structural integrity, which compromised its efficiency in flight.

### **Corrective Action:**  
A different airplane design will be tested to improve both stability and flight distance.

## **Test 2 – Small Model**  
**Flight Result:** Unsuccessful  

### **Test Description:**  
In this test, we used a smaller model, expecting better performance due to its lighter weight.

### **Observed Outcome:**  
Although the plane reached a reasonable distance of about **3 meters**, it curved sharply to the left, which caused a loss of direction and flight stability.

### **Test Video:**

### **Conclusion:**  
Directional instability compromised this model’s performance, making it unsuitable for the competition.

### **Corrective Action:**  
The plane’s design will be adjusted to improve its aerodynamics and lateral balance for a straighter, more stable flight.

## **Test 3 – Small Model with Different Paper**  
**Flight Result:** Unsuccessful  

### **Test Description:**  
We kept the same design used in Test 2 but used a different type of paper with higher stiffness and density, hoping for better flight performance.

### **Observed Outcome:**  
The plane showed improved initial flight distance, but suddenly lost lift mid-flight and dropped quickly in a downward motion, resembling a slide.

### **Test Video:**

### **Conclusion:**  
Although slightly better than the previous test, the issue of sudden lift loss persisted.

### **Corrective Action:**  
A new model will be tested while keeping the same paper type, as it contributed to improved takeoff performance.

## **Test 4 – Refined Dart Model**  
**Flight Result:** Successful  

### **Test Description:**  
We developed a new dart-style model with a slimmer design and well-folded structure to enhance aerodynamic performance.

### **Observed Outcome:**  
The plane performed excellently, maintaining a straight and stable trajectory. It flew for approximately **10 meters**, with consistent lift throughout the flight.

### **Test Video:**

### **Conclusion:**  
The combination of a thin structure and effective aerodynamic design resulted in a highly efficient and goal-aligned flight. This model proved to be the most suitable for the long-distance category.

### **Corrective Action:**  
No corrective actions needed. This model will be maintained as the current standard. Minor refinements may be considered for further optimization.
